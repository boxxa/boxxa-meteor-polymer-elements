#Meteor-Polymer-Elements
Polymer version 1.0.0

The version [ecwyne:polymer-elements](http://github.com/ecwyne/meteor-polymer-elements) hasn't been updated so forked it and am keeping the version updated as Polymer updates theirs so I would suggest rolling your own bower and package version for anything in production as this will stay current with Polymer. I am keeping this package version consistent with polymer. See below to install Polymer versions specific to your needs.

Same as the original, this package adds the elements functionality of Polymer.

##How to Install

```bash
meteor add boxxa:polymer-elements
```

This package version will remain consistent with Polymer so if you want to install this release in the future, run:
```bash
meteor add boxxa:polymer-elements@=0.5.5 // Installed previous 0.5.5 polymer
```
##How to Use
After your first `meteor run` you can browse your `[APP_DIR]/public/bower_components/` directory to find installed elements. See below for how to `<link rel="import"` these elements and start using them!

###Example
index.html
```html
<head>
  <!-- Add any <link rel="import" href="[path/to/element]"> tags you will use -->
	<link rel="import" href="bower_components/paper-checkbox/paper-checkbox.html">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Simply use elements in body or in templates -->
	<paper-checkbox checked></paper-checkbox>
</body>
```
